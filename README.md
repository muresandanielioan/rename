# rename
This short command line app will rename the files in a folder to "Picture_i" where i is the order of creation index(0 based).

Usage:
Prerequisites: have Node.js installed.

1. Have all the pictures(files) stored in one folder named at your liking. For the present example, let's call it Pictures.
2. Copy the rename.js file to the location of the Pictures folder. Let's say Pictures is located at C:\\experiments\Pictures. You should copy rename.js to C:\\experiments.
3. Open a terminal/command window and navigate to where you previously copied rename.js. That would be typing "cd C:\\experiments" for the present example. Hit Enter.
4. Run the application, sending the pictures(files) folder name. That would be typing:"node rename.js Pictures". Hit Enter.
